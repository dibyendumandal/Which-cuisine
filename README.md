# Which cuisine
*Can we predict the origin of a recipe (middle-easten, French, or Indian) from its ingredients?*

This is an end-to-end project involving data curated from [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/).  It applies standard classification algorithms (naive Bayes, logistic regression, and random forest) within the [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) framework to predict the cuisine type of recipe from its ingredients.  **Achieves 80% accuracy.** *Fun fact:* All algorithms confuse some middle-eastern dishes to be Indian. 

## Notebooks

As part of the project I analysed each of the cuisines first.  I downloaded the recipes from [Indian](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/233/world-cuisine/asian/indian/), [middle-eastern](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/235/world-cuisine/middle-eastern/), and [French](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/721/world-cuisine/european/french/) origin.  I analysed the typical ingredients present in these recipes in the following notebooks:

* [Indian](https://github.com/dibyendumandal/Which-cuisine/blob/master/Indian.ipynb)
* [Middle-eastern](https://github.com/dibyendumandal/Which-cuisine/blob/master/Middle_eastern.ipynb) 
* [French](https://github.com/dibyendumandal/Which-cuisine/blob/master/French.ipynb)

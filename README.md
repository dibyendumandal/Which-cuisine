# Which cuisine

This is an end-to-end project involving data curated from [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/).  It applies standard classification algorithms (naive Bayes, logistic regression, and random forest) within the [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) framework to predict the cuisine type of recipe from its ingredients.  **Achieves 80% accuracy.** *Fun fact:* All algorithms confuse some middle-eastern dishes to be Indian.

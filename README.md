# which_recipe
An end-to-end project involving data curated from allrecipes.com.  Applies standard classification algorithms (naive Bayes, logistic regression, and random forest) within the Scikit-Learn framework to predict the type of a cuisine from its ingredients.  Achieves 80% accuracy. Fun fact: All algorithms confuse some middle-eastern dishes to be Indian.
